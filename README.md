### Description

**Simplex Support Services** is a fully automated, on-call support service system. Created out of the frustration of needing to pre-configure AI and manage the potential of getting Arma'd, **SSS** is designed to make AI supports reliable and easy to use.

For usage instructions, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/SceptreOfficial/Simplex-Support-Services/wiki).

The mod is still under development, with many features yet to be implemented and bugs still to be found.
Feel free to submit issues or suggest any new features via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SceptreOfficial/Simplex-Support-Services/issues).

**Known Issues:**
- **AI drivers may not start moving immediately (sometimes even after several minutes).** This is a BI issue with AI pathing. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about it.
- **Sometimes artillery won't fire on target.** Might be BI fault with doArtilleryFire command.
- **Sometimes AI helicopter pilots don't land where they're requested.** I've done my best to counteract this and make it as uncommon as possible.
- **Remote controlling a drone while already remote controlling a gunship will get you stuck in remote control.** Respawning should get you un-stuck.
